# Tanker script

## Documentation for pilots

The tanker script offers no additional options to the pilots during the mission.

Its sole purpose is to ensure that tankers are available at all time.

Information about the tankers position or radio/TACAN frequencies can be found in the event's briefing or by contacting C2 agencie/ATC.

## Documentation for mission designers

The documentation for event hosts who would like to edit the tanker script behaviour can be found in the "tankers.lua" script itself.
